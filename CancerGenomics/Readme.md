#  Clinical Genomics Notes

This folder contains structured notes and literature summaries on clinical cancer genomics, focusing on the genetic and molecular basis of different cancer types. The goal is to compile research findings, methodologies, and clinical insights into cancer genomics, including biomarker identification, targeted therapies, and precision medicine applications. The content is organized by cancer type, covering key genetic alterations, sequencing approaches, and computational methods used for clinical interpretation.
