# **Genes Related to Cancer**

This section categorizes key genes involved in cancer into two groups: **oncogenes** and **tumor suppressor genes (TSGs)**. These genes influence cell proliferation, DNA repair, and apoptosis, playing crucial roles in cancer development and treatment.

## **Oncogenes**
Oncogenes promote cell growth and survival. When mutated or overexpressed, they drive cancer progression.

- **EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor)**: A receptor tyrosine kinase that enhances cell proliferation; commonly altered in lung, glioblastoma, and colorectal cancers.
- **MYC**: A transcription factor that regulates cell growth; frequently amplified in aggressive cancers like Burkitt lymphoma and breast cancer.
- **KRAS**: A signaling protein in the RAS/MAPK pathway; mutations are common in pancreatic, lung, and colorectal cancers.
- **BRAF**: A kinase involved in MAPK signaling; mutated in melanoma, thyroid, and colorectal cancers.

## **Tumor Suppressor Genes (TSGs)**
TSGs regulate cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Their loss or inactivation leads to uncontrolled growth.

- **TP53 (Tumor Protein p53)**: The "guardian of the genome," crucial for DNA damage repair and apoptosis; mutated in over 50% of cancers.
- **BRCA1/BRCA2 (Breast Cancer Genes 1 and 2)**: Involved in homologous recombination DNA repair; mutations increase breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer risk.
- **PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog)**: A key inhibitor of the PI3K/AKT pathway; mutations lead to enhanced survival and proliferation in cancers like glioblastoma and prostate cancer.
- **RB1 (Retinoblastoma Protein)**: Regulates cell cycle progression; mutations contribute to retinoblastoma and other malignancies.
