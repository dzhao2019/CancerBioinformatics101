# CancerBioinformatics101

This repository centered on the foundational knowledge of cancer bioinformatics. 

## Overview

This repository is a collection of my learning materials on the core concepts of cancer bioinformatics. 
It's designed to help me organize study notes, key resources, and foundational knowledge in this field.

**_Important Note:_** This is a public repository. 
Content focuses on theoretical concepts and learning materials.

## OUTLINE

This repository is organized around the following key areas:

* **Cancer Genomics:** Fundamental principles of cancer genetics and genomics.
* **Transcriptomics:** Theory and methods for analyzing gene expression in cancer.
* **Genomic Variation:** Concepts and techniques for studying variants in cancer genomes.
* **Databases & Resources:** Key cancer-specific databases and bioinformatics resources.
* **Literature:** Key papers, reviews, and publications relevant to cancer bioinformatics.


## Content Guidelines

To ensure clarity and focus, the following guidelines are used:

* **Theory over Practice:** Emphasize the underlying biological and bioinformatics principles.
* **Fundamental Concepts:** Focus on introductory to intermediate-level knowledge.
* **Resource Compilation:** Include links to papers, reviews, tutorials, and databases that explain core concepts.
* **Limit Code/Pipelines:** Avoid detailed code, scripts, or specific pipeline instructions (those belong in CancerGenomicsPipelines or Genomics-Wiki).
