# CancerBioinformatics101

Welcome to **CancerBioinformatics101** — a personal collection of resources, study notes, and workflows focused on cancer bioinformatics. This repository is designed to help me organize my learning materials, code snippets, and references as I explore various topics related to cancer research and bioinformatics.

## 📌 About This Repository

This is **not intended as an educational resource for others**, but rather a personal space where I document:
- Study notes on key concepts in cancer genomics and bioinformatics
- Resources such as articles, tutorials, and tool documentation
- Code snippets and hands-on exercises
- Workflows and pipelines for analyzing cancer-related datasets

## 🧬 Topics Covered
- Cancer Genomics & Mutation Profiling
- Transcriptomics & Expression Analysis
- Variant Calling and Annotation
- Copy Number Variation (CNV) Analysis
- Pathway Enrichment Analysis
- Tools like **GATK**, **Mutect2**, **VCFtools**, and more

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **R** & **Python** for data analysis
- Bioinformatics tools like **GATK**, **bcftools**, **samtools**
- Cancer-specific databases such as **TCGA**, **COSMIC**, **cBioPortal**


## 🚀 Getting Started
This repository is primarily for personal reference. However, feel free to explore if you're interested.
