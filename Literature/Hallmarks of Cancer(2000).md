# **Hallmarks of Cancer (2000)**

In their seminal 2000 paper, Hanahan and Weinberg identified six fundamental biological capabilities that drive cancer progression. These hallmarks provide a framework for understanding tumor development and behavior.

## **The Six Original Hallmarks of Cancer**

1. **Self-Sufficiency in Growth Signals**  
   - Cancer cells acquire the ability to produce their own growth signals, bypassing the need for external growth factors.

2. **Insensitivity to Growth Suppressors**  
   - Tumor cells evade regulatory mechanisms that normally inhibit cell proliferation, such as tumor suppressor genes (e.g., TP53, RB1).

3. **Evading Apoptosis**  
   - Cancer cells resist programmed cell death by disrupting apoptotic pathways (e.g., overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins like BCL-2).

4. **Limitless Replicative Potential**  
   - Tumor cells overcome normal cellular senescence by activating telomerase, enabling unlimited cell divisions.

5. **Sustained Angiogenesis**  
   - Cancer cells stimulate the formation of new blood vessels to ensure a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients.

6. **Tissue Invasion and Metastasis**  
   - Tumor cells acquire the ability to invade surrounding tissues and spread to distant organs via the bloodstream or lymphatic system.

These hallmarks laid the foundation for further discoveries in cancer biology and the development of targeted therapies.
